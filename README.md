# Data-Analysis-India-Education-
The analysis performed on an old dataset from Arc GIS Hub


completelty made by me with lots of search, execute, try and errors

shape files are in ./shapefiles/(extracted files)

other data files are either generated manually by the program  and some of them were downloaded you might not find them in root directory

Reports are in ./reprts you can find a PDF file in there

for rendering the .nbhtml or pdf perform a knit in the .Rmd as per your requirement

original Project gave my 95%

Thank You! Happy Viewing
